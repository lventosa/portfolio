### **US Breweries Analysis** <a name="breweries"></a>

This simple project analyzes the geographical location and the different types of breweries in the United States. The majority of the analysis explores the relationship between states and types of breweries. Patterns on the names of the different breweries are explored as well. Moreover, basic data visualization techniques are performed across the whole project.

Language: **Python**. Project notebook available [here](./us-breweries/us-breweries.ipynb).

### **Who painted what? Artist Prediction Using Deep Learning** <a name="artists"></a>

This project consists of two separated parts. It first analyzes data from the 50 most influencial artists of all time using basic data exploration and visualization techniques. Secondly, a deep learning model is constructed to identify the author of a given painting. --> 2nd part: still in the making

Language: **Python**. Project notebook available [here](./art-history/artist-predictor.ipynb).

### **Mathematicians of Wikipedia** <a name="mathematicians"></a>
